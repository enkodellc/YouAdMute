# YouMute

This Chrome extension automatically mutes and blurs annoying video ads that show up on YouTube.  It also auto clicks the "Skip Ad" button as soon as it becomes enabled.  Any other dismissable ads or boxes that sometimes appear over top of the video are never shown.

1. In Chrome go to Window > Extensions

- Clicking the button again will turn YouMute off in case you want to see the blocked content again.
- Notice the background color of YouTube.com will look red when this mode is enabled.
